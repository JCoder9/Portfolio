<div class="hero-section">
  <p class="bio">
    A multidisciplinary developer with experience in full-stack web
    applications, mobile interfaces, machine learning projects, and game
    development. He has industry experience working within professional team
    environments, following established standards and collaborating through
    proper processes. However, the majority of his skills were developed through
    completing practical, self-directed projects, which has made him comfortable
    learning new tools quickly and solving problems independently.
  </p>

  <p class="bio">
    His portfolio spans several domains — e-commerce systems, Unity-based games,
    AI/ML tools, mobile applications, news-aggregation workflows, and multimedia
    production. Because he has worked across both creative and technical fields,
    he tends to approach problems with a mix of systematic thinking and
    experimentation. He can build functional systems end-to-end, adapt to new
    frameworks with minimal ramp-up time, and break down unfamiliar problems
    into workable steps.

    <h3>Working Style</h3>
    <p class="bio">
      Jordan learns quickly, prefers hands-on experimentation, and is
      comfortable building features from scratch when documentation is limited.
      He thinks through edge cases, focuses on maintainability, and isn't afraid
      to refactor when something can be cleaner. He combines analytical
      problem-solving with a creative mindset, which helps him handle both
      structured engineering tasks and open-ended design challenges.
